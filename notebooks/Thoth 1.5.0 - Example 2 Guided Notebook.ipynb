    "\n",
    "All the direct dependencies are parsed and resolved given the version ranges stated in `Pipfile`. The resolution is done offline but respecting `pip`'s logic (`pip`'s internal resolution logic is reused), based on Thoth's resolver implemented on top of the graph instance (resolution is thus faster and respects packages known to Thoth - packages already analyzed). This resolution is done cross-package source index, meaning you can configure Thoth to be a resolver on top of different Python package indexes. This is something some tools *partially* supprt (such as [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/#specifying-package-indexes)), however in Python ecosystem, all package sources are treated as mirrors. If a package cannot be found on one package index, current tools silently fallback to another Python package index which can be miss-leading or undesired in some cases (e.g. if you want to consume optimized TensorFlow wheel files [from AICoE index](http://tensorflow.pypi.thoth-station.ninja), you don't want to fallback to an un-optimized upstream TensorFlow release, see [Thoth's provenance checks](https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser#provenance-checks) for more info and for provenance gating). This issue is present also in Pipenv even though the [docs](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/#specifying-package-indexes) do not state it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the resolution is done on direct dependencies, there are issued queries to JanusGraph instance to gather transitive dependencies of all the direct dependencies in a specific version from a specific package source index respecting their version ranges (on specific environment, in this case Fedora 29 with Python 3.6). The result of query is in fact, a serialized dependency graph as stored in the Thoth's graph database.\n",
    "\n",
    "As some of the packages are *NOT* installable into the given environment (e.g. too old versions which do not run on Python 3+, but run only on legacy Python 2) are automatically removed in a *cut-off* phase. This way we reduce stacks we know they will not work at all and reduce space traversed during stacks generation. Another type of packages which are removed in the *cut-off phase* are \"core\" Python packages which we pick automatically to the latest working release (e.g. `setuptools`, `pip`, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the step above is done, Thoth's adviser implementation sorts packages in the resulting query in such way, they can be used to generate software stacks systematically, from the latest stack to the oldest one. This way, there are prefered newer stacks in comparision to the older ones - the newer stack is, the sooner it gets scored and takes precedence in case of same score with another but older software stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user supplies `limit_latest_versions` option, there are removed older versions of each package (in the example above, there are considered only 2 latest versions of each package). This option helps to reduce space - for larger stacks, number of stacks result in a really huge number and the depedency graph traversal does not fit into memory (you can try it by yourself by removing `limit_latest_versions` parameter or setting it to `None`). See estimation in the adviser log to check number of stacks estimated for scoring - `estimated stacks count` (its estimation - upper bound, the actual number may, and usually will, differ based on the dependency graph traversal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are ready to perform the actual graph traversal. The current implemenation uses a subprocess which calls to [C/C++ dependency graph implementation](https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser/blob/master/docs/libdependency_graph.md) implemented in a form of a library. The subprocess generates a stream of stacks which is consumed by the parent process (see [docs for more info](https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser/blob/master/docs/libdependency_graph.md)) to perform stack scoring. As stated above, there are generated stacks from the newest one to the oldest one. The actual scoring is performed based on data stored in the graph database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook we show \"STABLE\" recommendation type which covers performance based scoring, data for this scoring we have already synced as shown above (see syncs of inspection documents). To get familiar with other types of scoring see other Thoth notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring is computed as an average of performance related inspection runs, where inspections which show that the stack does not work have negative (-1.0) performance score, where positive performance scores reflect performance score in inspections (see [thoth-station/performance](https://github.com/thoth-station/performance) for performance indicators used).\n",
    "\n",
    "As some of the packages do not have performance impact on a software stack, Thoth uses [Isis](https://github.com/thoth-station/isis-api) and its [feature based queries on top of project2vec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Nghre5s4O8MUvslU2n_avznEmF78gOiDq_Xe6ygMjc/). In this case the query consists of only \"core performance\" packages (without for example `markdown` package in case of TensorFlow stacks) which do affect performance in any way. Thoth internally queries Isis API (which is an API for project2vec vector space). If you would like to suppress this behaviour and rather ask for exact match on software stack, just omit `ISIS_API_URL` environment variable - stacks will be scored based on exact match in the graph database."
