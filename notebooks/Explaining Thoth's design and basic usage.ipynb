    "[Thoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth) is an analytics platform that helps you explore, examine and build recommendations for software packages and (not only) AI software stacks in Python. It runs on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) and allows you to use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks to interact with the system. Thoth comes with packages that have some useful pre-baked code that will help you with repetative routines, querying for data in data stores or with integration with popular scientific Python packages such as [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and others.\n",

    "The aim of this notebook is to create an interactive guide on how to use Thoth, how Thoth is designed, how to use its packages and how to explore system's features and abilities. All Thoth packages are open source, installable on your system via standard Python packaging system. Also, Thoth is deployable to your own cluster."

This allows to reuse parts in production deployment, simplify unit and integration tests as well as reusability in notebooks such as this one following the well known Unix idea: *\"Do one thing and do it well\"*. Currently, there are available the following Thoth packages:\n",

    " * [thoth-analyzer](https://github.com/fridex/thoth-analyzer) - code that is shared across analyzers (such as solver or package-extract, see bellow)\n",
    " * [thoth-common](https://github.com/fridex/thoth-common) - a common library that shares code for cluster deployment, such as configuration of logging facilities\n",
    " * [thoth-lab](https://github.com/fridex/thoth-lab) - various helpers intended to be used with Jupyter notebooks or experiments\n",
    " * [thoth-package-extract](https://github.com/fridex/thoth-package-extract) - extraction of packages rpm or Python packages available inside images\n",
    " * [thoth-solver](https://github.com/fridex/thoth-solver) - a library providing solvers to resolve requirements such the ones as stated in Python's requirements.txt file\n",
